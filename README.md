# Alaska Journey

Welcome to the source code of my blog developed as part of the penultimate project of my OpenClassrooms course.

## Description

"Alaska Journey" is a personal blog where I share my thoughts, stories, and experiences related to my travels in Alaska. This project was developed in PHP without using a framework, thus offering a purely customized approach to creating and managing a blog.
